          <p class="text-small">
            Blogging is a great way to show your talents and interests to
            prospective employers, while adding an edge to your resume. If you
            blog consistently it shows your dedication, passions and creativity
            – all of which are key attributes employers look for in job
            candidates. ~Lauren Conrad

          “There is more, much more than I could ever absorb, even if it were
          spread out over a semester long course. On the reasonable assumption
          that none of us is planning to go home and curl up with the ‘Wal-Mart
          Associate Handbook,’ our trainers start reading it out loud to us,
          pausing every few paragraphs to ask, ‘Any questions?’ There never are.
          Barry, the seventeen year old to my left, mutters that his ‘butt
          hurts.’” — Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and Dimed, on Wal-Mart
          training

          “One of the greatest things about blogging, is that there’s always
          something you can be doing better. The sky truly is the limit. In the
          8+ years, I’ve been working on my blog, I’ve never encountered
          something where I didn’t think, “This is good, but how can I get even
          better results?” Developing a mindset of perpetual learning and growth
          is also cited as one of the most impactful blogging tips I’ve heard
          from successful bloggers. I’m always experimenting with my blog, from
          redesigning the look of my website, testing different email clients,
          or just looking for different ways I can make money blogging. By
          adopting a willingness to constantly make my blog better, I’m able to
          always challenge myself to learn something new or to push myself to
          improve wherever I can.” — Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          “On a personal level, getting into the habit of blogging regularly can
          have an incredibly powerful impact on your career. Even if you’re not
          looking to make money from your blog, by consistently publishing
          high-quality and valuable content you naturally set yourself apart as
          an expert and authority. For anyone looking to establish their
          personal brand, blogging is a wonderful way to demonstrate your
          personality, your expertise and your level of influence.” — Barbara
